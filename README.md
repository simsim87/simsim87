# About Me
## My interests
My hobbies and academic pursuits span across several areas of interest. A large portion of my free time is dedicated to drawing and designing characters for video game concepts. This combines my love for art with storytelling, where I can create imaginative worlds and compelling characters. Additionally, I am pursuing a degree in IT services and support, which perfectly aligns with my passion for technology.
Outside of my studies and creative endeavors, I deeply enjoy spending time with my family, especially with my son and fiancÃ©e. Together, we explore new activities, whether it's outdoor adventures or bonding over simple pleasures like watching movies. Family time is central to my life, providing balance and joy.
