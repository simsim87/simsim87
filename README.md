# About Me
## My interests
My hobbies and academic pursuits span across several areas of interest. A large portion of my free time is dedicated to drawing and designing characters for video game concepts. This combines my love for art with storytelling, where I can create imaginative worlds and compelling characters. Additionally, I am pursuing a degree in IT services and support, which perfectly aligns with my passion for technology.
Outside of my studies and creative endeavors, I deeply enjoy spending time with my family, especially with my son and fiancÃ©e. Together, we explore new activities, whether it's outdoor adventures or bonding over simple pleasures like watching movies. Family time is central to my life, providing balance and joy.
## Websites I recommend
[https://krebsonsecurity.com/]
I find this website compelling because it offers in-depth analysis and reporting on cybersecurity threats, breaches, and emerging trends. Brian Krebs is one of the most well-known investigative journalists in the field, and his blog provides practical advice and a wealth of information for anyone interested in cybersecurity, which ties directly into my academic interests.

As someone who enjoys character design and concept art, ArtStation is a go-to platform for creative inspiration. Itâ€™s home to an enormous community of artists, from beginners to professionals, sharing their portfolios and designs. I love browsing the diverse range of art styles and ideas, which helps spark my own creativity when working on game concepts.
